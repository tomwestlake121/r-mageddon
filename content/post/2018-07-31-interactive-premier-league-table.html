<p>For my inaugural blog post I decided I would step into the world of animated graphics for the first time. I was inspired by the <a href="(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21ZWDrTukEs)">presentation</a> that Thomas Lin Pedersen gave at the <a href="https://user2018.r-project.org/">useR!</a> conference on <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/gganimate">gganimate</a> and was motivated to create my very first gif.</p>
<p>I rooted around for ideas and decided upon creating an animated table of the Premier League for the last season, with the clubs being depicted by their crests. A quick google pointed me towards a <a href="https://www.football-data.org/">free football API</a> and that was already an <a href="https://github.com/dashee87/footballR">R package</a> to interface with this API. NB: This API has since been updated to v2, which isn’t currently supported by the linked package, but is perfectly fine for the historical dataset I wished to extract.</p>
<p>So the first thing we need to do is install and load the relevant packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(c(&quot;tidyverse&quot;, &quot;ggimage&quot;))
devtools::install_github(&quot;thomasp85/gganimate&quot;)
devtools::install_github(&quot;dashee87/footballR&quot;)

library(tidyverse)
library(footballR)
library(gganimate) 
library(ggimage)</code></pre>
<p>Now as I wished to make multiple calls to the football-data API, I registered an account that would give me an API token key. Then I set this key in my script (not shared for obvious reasons.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_token &lt;- &quot;xxx&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>fdo_leagueTable</code> function would give me the final league table data for any competition, for any competition id I provided. The id for the Premier League 2017/18 season was 445. However I also wanted to get the league table positions for all 38 match days, so I needed to iterate through multiple API calls, varying the matchDay argument. Firstly however I wanted to define the function beforehand so the result was a tidy dataframe, allowing me to utilise the <code>purrr</code> function <code>map_rdf</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>import_tidy_table &lt;- function(x){
  data &lt;- fdo_leagueTable(id = 445,response = &quot;full&quot;, matchDay = x, token = my_token)
  data &lt;- data$standing
  data$`_links` &lt;- NULL
  data$home &lt;- NULL
  data$away &lt;- NULL
  final_data &lt;- data
}</code></pre>
<p>Next I iterate through the first 19 matchdays first, to not call upon the API too many times within a single minute. (I’m sure there must be a better way of doing this)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>first_19_matches &lt;- map_dfr(1:19, import_tidy_table, .id = &quot;match_day&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(match = as.numeric(match_day))</code></pre>
<p>Upon waiting a minute I run again for the second half of the Premier League season, not forgetting to add 19 to get the correct match day value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>last_19_matches &lt;- map_dfr(20:38, import_tidy_table, .id = &quot;match_day&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(match_day = as.numeric(match_day) + 19)</code></pre>
<p>As I want to start the graphic at the beginning of the season, I create a dataset where match day is 0 and bind all my data together. Additionally I a new column, img, which is the path to each teams crest and I turn match_day into an integer, for better showcasing in my gif title.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- first_19_matches %&gt;%
  filter(match_day == 1) %&gt;%
  mutate(match_day = 0) %&gt;%
  arrange(teamName) %&gt;%
  mutate(position = 1:n()) %&gt;%
  bind_rows(first_19_matches) %&gt;%
  bind_rows(last_19_matches) %&gt;%
  mutate(img = paste0(&quot;logos/&quot;, teamName, &quot;.png&quot;)) %&gt;%
  mutate(match_day = as.integer(match_day))</code></pre>
<p>Now the final section of code will be used to create my animation!! I pass my data to ggplot, with x being the match day and y being the position. I then pass the crests, from the img variable, to the <code>geom_image</code> function and add match day to transition_time so the crests will move along the x axis. I tried a few variations around this, with x being the team name for example, but I felt this combinated offered the best output. Next I create a set of coloured blocks to represent the winner, those teams that qualify for the Champions League and those teams that are relegated. Finally I reverse the y axis scale to depict the winning team at the top, which seemed much more logical.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data, aes(match_day, position)) + geom_image(aes(image = img)) + theme_bw() +
  labs(x = &quot;Match Day&quot;, y = &quot;Standing&quot;, title = &#39;2017/18 Premier League - Match Day: {frame_time}&#39;) + transition_time(match_day) +
  geom_tile(alpha = 0.05, aes(x = 19, width = 40, y = 1, fill = &quot;a&quot;)) + 
  geom_tile(alpha = 0.05, aes(x = 19, width = 40, y = 3, height = 3, fill = &quot;b&quot;)) + geom_tile(alpha = 0.05, aes(x = 19, width = 40,y = 19,height = 3.5, fill = &quot;c&quot;)) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;darkgreen&quot;, &quot;darkolivegreen3&quot;, &quot;firebrick4&quot;)) + 
  scale_y_reverse() + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>So there we have my animated Premier League table, a fairly good result for my first try. Two particular areas I want to improve are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The image quality of the crests is quite low, I did improve this somewhat by finding smaller .png files, but there is still plenty of room for improvement.</li>
<li>I think a coloured line that follows behind each team’s crest would add a lot to this animation. I did spend a little time trying, but the line only appeared for the current match day.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. As with all attemps to create a final output, there were plenty of abominations along the way. As it’s important to show your failures, as well as your successes, I’ve inserted a couple of them below.</p>
