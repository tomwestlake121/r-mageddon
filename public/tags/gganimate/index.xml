      <description>Whilst browsing twitter last night I came upon this tweet by the currrent author of gganimate:
I&#39;ve started a gganimate wiki page in order to collect examples. If you want to showcase your animations and help others learn in the process, consider submitting an issue as described on the main page #rstats https://t.co/VrT5IV2izr— Thomas Lin Pedersen (@thomasp85) August 16, 2018Now I’ve been experimenting a lot with creating animations with R, and I absolutely love using gganimate .</description>

      <description>For my inaugural blog post I decided I would step into the world of animated graphics for the first time. I was inspired by the presentation that Thomas Lin Pedersen gave at the useR! conference on gganimate and was motivated to create my very first gif.
I rooted around for ideas and decided upon creating an animated table of the Premier League for the last season, with the clubs being depicted by their crests.</description>
